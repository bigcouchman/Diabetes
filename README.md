## Inspiration
Diabetes is a prevalent issue affecting millions of people worldwide. According to the CDC, 38.4 million Americans had some form of diabetes in 2021, and this number continues to rise. Individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes must actively monitor their blood sugar levels, take prescribed medications, and make lifestyle adjustments to stay healthy. Managing diabetes can be challenging, given its impact on the body. Our system, **GlycoHealth**, aims to help individuals with diabetes better manage their blood sugar levels and make healthier lifestyle choices in a guided manner, ensuring they can navigate the challenges of their condition.

## What it does
GlycoHealth is a system designed to analyze a person’s diabetic conditions and provide personalized guidance for maintaining a healthy life. The system takes into account several key factors:

- Blood glucose level
- Daily carbohydrate intake
- Diabetes type (Type 1 or Type 2)
- Physical activity level (frequency of workouts)

Based on these factors, the system determines whether any additional actions or lifestyle adjustments are necessary to maintain optimal health.

## How we built it
We developed GlycoHealth using the following tools and technologies:

- **Prolog** for reasoning and logic-based decision-making
- **Ubuntu terminal** for testing the application
- **Visual Studio Code** with the Ciao extension for writing and debugging the code

Our team collaborated to write and debug the program, using Prolog's powerful reasoning capabilities to enhance decision-making processes.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Learning a new language**: We encountered a learning curve while working with Prolog and other new tools.
- **Debugging errors**: We faced challenges in debugging syntax and runtime errors that arose during development.
- **Multiple Output Printing**: We faced printing printing multiple responses when outputting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Successful application development**: We built an application that enables individuals with diabetes to better manage their blood sugar levels.
- **Learning Prolog**: We gained proficiency in Prolog and applied reasoning-based learning to guide the system’s responses.
- **Integrating logic and human reasoning**: We successfully incorporated human reasoning and logic into our programming to create a more intuitive and effective system.

## What we learned
- **Prolog and s(CASP)**: We learned how to use Prolog and s(CASP) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of our system.
- **Diabetes management**: We gained a deeper understanding of the different types of diabetes and best practices for managing these conditions effectively.
- **Team collaboration**: Working as a team is complex and making sure everyone is on the same page takes practice and dedication. Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of how to collaborate as a team for future projects.

## What's next for GlycoHealth
Moving forward, **GlycoHealth** aims to:

- **Expand to pre-diabetics and non-diabetics**: Provide advice and guidance on health and carbohydrate intake to those who wish to prevent diabetes.
- **Consult more research**: Incorporate insights from endocrinologists and other healthcare professionals to enhance the system's accuracy and recommendations.
- **Implement a chatbot feature**: Integrate OpenAI’s API with Prolog’s reasoning capabilities to provide a more conversational and interactive user experience.
